A simple wordle game helper with better algorithm. Release edition is coming soon:)

Early build:
```
g++ wlh.h main.cpp wordle.cpp -o <BinaryFileName> -std=c++17 -O2
```

To let the program recognize dictionary files, putting them(your customized or default in this repo) in the same folder, files named `<[0,7]>.txt`.

Have fun!
